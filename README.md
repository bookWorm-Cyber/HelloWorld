# Intro Demo
The project is titled "hello world" and is an attempt at understanding how git and github works.

## Description
In this repository, I have a simple hello world program in C++. I was also learning how to create pull requests, so it includes a statement about pull requests, too. 

This is me testing out how to create a README.md file
- testing if this would create a bullet point list
- let me know about any important steps to learn about git!
- just tests :)


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd repository-name

# Install dependencies
npm install
